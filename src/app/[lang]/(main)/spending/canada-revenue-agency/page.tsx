              The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is the federal institution
              responsible for administering tax laws, enforcing compliance, and
              delivering key benefit programs to individuals and businesses
              across Canada. Established in 1999 under the Canada Revenue Agency
              Act, the CRA operates with a workforce of approximately 59,155
              employees (2024) and oversees tax revenues totaling $379 billion
              annually—which accounts for over 82% of federal revenues. It also
              administers over $46 billion in benefits and credits to Canadians,
              including the Canada Child Benefit and the GST/HST credit.

              The Canada Revenue Agency spent $16.8 billion in fiscal year (FY)
              2024, representing 3.2% of the $513.9 billion in total federal
              spending. The CRA's expenditures primarily support tax
              administration, benefit program delivery, compliance enforcement,
              and IT modernization.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to economic fluctuations,
              changes in tax policy, and the expansion of benefit programs.
              Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%, while Canada
              Revenue Agency spending has increased 302%

              CRA's spending grew more than overall spending, meaning its share
              of the federal budget increased. In 2024, the agency accounted for
              3.2% of all federal spending, 1.85 percentage points higher than
              in 1995.

              Major legislative changes, compliance trends, and digital tax
              services have influenced CRA spending patterns. For example,
              compliance initiatives and fraud investigations recovered an
              estimated $11.5 billion in lost revenue in 2024 due to tax
              evasion.

              Most federal spending can be categorized as direct or indirect.
              Direct spending refers to money the federal government spends on
              budget items such as federal programs, employee salaries, and debt
              interest. Indirect spending refers to federal transfers to other
              levels of government.

              CRA spending is divided across tax administration, compliance
              enforcement, benefit program delivery, and intergovernmental
              agreements with provinces and territories. The largest
              expenditures in FY 2024 included personal income tax processing,
              corporate tax audits, and benefit administration.
