              ISED spent $10.2 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024. This was 2% of
              the $513.9 billion in overall federal spending. The department
              ranked eleventh among federal departments in total spending.

              While not in the top 10 departments by spend, ISED accounted for
              2% of all federal spending in FY 2024. 10 government departments

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging problems to address.
              Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%, while ISED
              spending has increased 90.3%.

              The department's spending has grown more than overall spending,
              which means that the department's share of the federal budget has
              increased. In FY 2024, ISED accounted for 2% of all federal
              spending, 0.17 percentage points higher than in 1995.

              Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
              influence government spending year to year. For instance, during
              the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from
              $410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to
              $720.3 billion in 2021.

              Similarly, ISED's expenditures have increased during this period,
              growing from approximately $6.5 billion​ in 2019 (adjusted for
              inflation) to $10.2 billion in 2024.
