              The Department of Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) is the federal
              department responsible for supporting and serving Canadian
              veterans, active-duty military personnel, and their families. It
              provides financial assistance, healthcare support, rehabilitation
              services, and recognition programs to honor the contributions of
              those who have served in the Canadian Armed Forces. Additionally,
              the department is responsible for remembrance initiatives that
              preserve Canada's military history.

              the $513.9 billion in overall federal spending. The department
              ranked thirteenth among federal departments in total spending.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging problems to address.
              Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 77%, while VAC
              spending has increased 51%.

              The department's spending has grown less than overall spending,
              which means that the department's share of the federal budget has
              increased. In FY 2024, VAC accounted for 1.1% of all federal
              spending, about the same share as in 1995.

              Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
              influence government spending year to year. For instance, during
              the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from
              $410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to
              $720.3 billion in 2021.

              VAC's expenditures also grew slightly during this period,
              increasing from approximately $5.5B​ in 2019 when adjusted for
              inflation to $6.3B in 2024.
