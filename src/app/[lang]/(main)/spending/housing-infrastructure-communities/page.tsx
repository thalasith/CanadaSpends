              responsible for federal policies and programs that support public
              infrastructure, affordable housing, and community development. It
              works with provinces, territories, and municipalities to fund
              major infrastructure projects and improve housing affordability
              across Canada.

              HICC administers the National Housing Strategy, which funds the
              construction, repair, and preservation of affordable housing. It
              also oversees the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC),
              which provides mortgage insurance and financing programs. The
              department supports public transit, clean energy, and community
              infrastructure through programs like the Canada Infrastructure

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,

              When HICC was founded in FY 2005 as the Office of Infrastructure
              Canada, the department's spending has grown from $250,000 to over
              $14 billion, a significant increase in overall spending and
              mandate. In FY 2024, HICC accounted for 2.8% of all federal
              spending.

              Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
              influence government spending year to year. For instance, during
              the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from
              $410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to
              $720.3 billion in 2021.

              Similarly, HICC expenditures experienced notable fluctuations
              during this period, surging from approximately $5.9 billion​ in
              2019 (adjusted for inflation) to $14.5B in 2024.

              Federal departments often contain other entities including
              offices, crown corporations and agencies. In FY 2024, HICC
              entities with the highest expenditures were Office of
              Infrastructure Canada, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
              and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority.
