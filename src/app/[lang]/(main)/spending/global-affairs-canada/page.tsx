              Global Affairs Canada (GAC) is the federal department responsible
              for managing Canada's diplomatic relations, international trade,
              and development assistance. Established in 1909 as the Department
              of External Affairs, GAC has evolved to oversee Canada's
              engagement in global affairs, promoting national interests abroad
              and ensuring the protection of Canadian citizens overseas. The
              department negotiates international agreements, administers trade
              policies, and provides humanitarian aid. Additionally, it supports
              Canadian businesses in expanding internationally and strengthens
              diplomatic ties through multilateral organizations like the United
              Nations, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and NATO. GAC also
              plays a critical role in crisis response, assisting Canadians
              abroad during emergencies, and fostering global security and
              stability.

              Global Affairs Canada spent $19.2 billion in fiscal year (FY)
              2024, representing 3.7% of the $513.9 billion in overall federal
              spending. This placed GAC among the mid-sized federal departments
              in terms of total expenditures.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to changing global
              circumstances, diplomatic priorities, and Canada's economic
              relationships. Since 1995, overall federal spending has increased
              by 74.9%, while Global Affairs Canada's budget has grown by
              166.5%, reflecting an expansion in international engagement.

              While GAC's spending has increased in real terms, its share of the
              federal budget has also increased moderately over the past
              decades. In 2024, GAC accounted for 3.7% of federal spending,
              compared to 2% in 1995.

              Major international events, trade agreements, foreign aid
              commitments, and global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic have
              influenced fluctuations in spending. In 2020, GAC's budget surged
              due to emergency international assistance programs, including
              vaccine distribution and humanitarian relief efforts.

              climate adaptation, gender equality, and health initiatives in
              developing nations. The department also facilitates economic
              diplomacy and trade agreements that benefit Canadian businesses
