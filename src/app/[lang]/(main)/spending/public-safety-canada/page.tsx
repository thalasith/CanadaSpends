              Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental
              Affairs Canada (Public Safety Canada) is the federal department
              responsible for national security, emergency preparedness, and
              community safety. Established in 2003, it consolidates security,
              law enforcement, and emergency management functions. It includes
              the RCMP, CSIS, and CBSA and coordinates federal responses to
              threats and develops policies on crime prevention, cyber
              resilience, and disaster preparedness while overseeing
              intelligence-sharing with domestic and international partners.

              Public Safety Canada spent $13.9 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024,
              accounting for 2.7% of the $513.9 billion in total federal
              spending. While not among the largest departments by expenditure,
              Public Safety Canada plays a crucial role in national security and
              emergency management, working in tandem with multiple agencies to
              mitigate threats and enhance public safety.

              Federal spending on public safety fluctuates based on evolving
              security threats, emergency events, and changes in government
              policy. Since 2005 shortly after it was established, Public Safety
              Canada's expenditures have increased by 69.6%, reflecting
              heightened investments in counterterrorism, cyber defence, and
              disaster response capabilities. The department's share of the
              federal budget has remained relatively flat from 2.6% in 2005 to
              2.7% in 2024.

              Major policy shifts, unforeseen events such as natural disasters,
              and global security concerns can significantly impact the
              department's annual spending. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example,
              led to a sharp increase in federal emergency response funding in
              2020.
