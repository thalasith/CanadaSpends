              The Department of Finance (Finance Canada) is a central federal
              department responsible for overseeing the nation's economic and
              fiscal policies, ensuring financial stability, and managing the
              government's fiscal framework. Established in 1867 as one of the
              original departments following Confederation, it advises the Prime
              Minister and Cabinet on economic matters, develops tax and tariff
              policies, and prepares the annual federal budget.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging problems to address.
              Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%, while
              Department of Finance spending has increased 41.4%.

              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can affect spending year
              to year. For example, the federal expenses fluctuated during the
              pandemic, rising from $410.2 billion (in 2024 dollars) in 2019 to
              $420 billion in 2020 and $720.3 billion in 2021

              Most federal spending can be categorized as direct or indirect.
              Direct spending refers to money the federal government spends on
              budget items such as federal programs, employee salaries, and debt
              interest. Indirect spending refers to federal transfers to other
              levels of government.
