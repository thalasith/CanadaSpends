              Established in 2005, ESDC is a federal department responsible for
              supporting Canadians through social programs and workforce
              development. It administers key programs such as Employment
              Insurance (EI), the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security
              (OAS), and skills training initiatives. ESDC also oversees Service
              Canada, which delivers government services directly to the public.

              ESDC spent $94.48 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024. This was 18.4%
              of the $513.9 billion in overall federal spending, making it one
              of the highest-spending federal departments.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging challenges. Since
              2005, when ESDC was first established, overall federal spending
              has risen 62.9%, while ESDC spending has increased 1,485%.

              The department's spending grew at a rate significantly higher than
              overall spending, reflecting shifts in federal priorities. In
              2024, ESDC accounted for 18.4% of all federal spending, 16.51
              percentage points higher than in 2005.

              For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, federal support
              programs led to a temporary surge in spending. ESDC expenditures
              increased from $63.3 billion in 2019 to $169.2 billion in 2021
              before stabilizing in recent years.
