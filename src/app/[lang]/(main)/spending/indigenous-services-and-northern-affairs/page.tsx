              Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) and Crown-Indigenous Relations
              and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) are two distinct federal
              departments tasked with advancing Indigenous priorities in Canada.
              Established in 2017 following the dissolution of Indigenous and
              Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), these departments manage different
              aspects of Indigenous policy, service delivery, and governance.

              ISC is responsible for providing essential services to First
              Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities, including healthcare,
              education, housing, and child and family services. It also works
              to transfer control of these services to Indigenous-led
              organizations. CIRNAC focuses on treaty negotiations,
              self-government agreements, land claims, and Northern affairs,
              aiming to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships and modernize
              Indigenous governance structures. Together, ISC and CIRNAC oversee
              key programs that impact Indigenous communities across Canada.

              In fiscal year (FY) 2024, ISC and CIRNAC collectively spent{" "}
              <strong>$63 billion</strong>, accounting for{" "}
              <strong>12.3% of the total federal budget</strong>. The
              departments play a critical role in addressing socio-economic

              Federal spending on Indigenous priorities may fluctuate over time
              due to population growth, policy shifts, and emerging challenges
              such as climate change and infrastructure deficits. Since 1995,
              total federal spending has risen by 74.9%, while spending on
              Indigenous priorities has increased by 592%, reflecting expanded
              program commitments and new governance agreements and claim
              settlements.

              Most federal spending can be categorized as direct or indirect.
              Direct spending refers to money the federal government spends on
              budget items such as federal programs, employee salaries, and debt
              interest. Indirect spending refers to federal transfers to other
              levels of government.
