              The Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed
              Forces (CAF) are responsible for ensuring Canada's security and
              defence through military operations, infrastructure management,
              and personnel support. Established in 1923 under the National
              Defence Act, DND oversees the defence budget, military
              procurement, and readiness planning, while the CAF executes
              domestic and international operations. The department provides
              strategic defence policy guidance and works with international
              allies, including NATO and NORAD, to ensure national security. DND
              also administers military health services, housing programs, and
              recruitment initiatives to support its personnel.

              The Department of National Defence spent $34.5 billion in fiscal
              year (FY) 2024. This represented 6.7% of the $513.9 billion in
              total federal spending. DND ranked among the top federal
              departments in expenditures, largely driven by personnel costs,
              military procurement, and operational readiness efforts.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to geopolitical tensions,
              defence modernization needs, and emerging threats such as cyber
              warfare. Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%,
              while Department of National Defence spending has increased 59.9%.

              DND's spending grew less than overall spending, meaning its share
              of the federal budget decreased. In 2024, the department accounted
              for 6.7% of all federal spending, 0.6 percentage points lower than
              in 1995.

              Most federal spending can be categorized as direct or indirect.
              Direct spending refers to money the federal government spends on
              budget items such as federal programs, employee salaries, and debt
              interest. Indirect spending refers to federal transfers to other
              levels of government.

                Federal departments often include additional agencies, commands,
                and operational divisions. In FY 2024, the largest spending
                entities within DND were the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian
                Navy, and the Royal Canadian Air Force, accounting for the bulk
                of military expenditures.
