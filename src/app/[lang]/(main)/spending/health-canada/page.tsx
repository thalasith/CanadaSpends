              Health Canada is the federal department responsible for protecting
              and improving the health of Canadians. It develops health
              policies, regulates pharmaceuticals and medical devices, enforces
              food safety standards, and funds public health programs. The
              department works with provinces and territories to support the
              healthcare system while ensuring safety standards for drugs,
              consumer products, and nutrition guidelines.

              Health Canada spent $13.7 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024. This
              was 2.7% of the $513.9 billion in overall federal spending. The
              department ranked tenth among federal departments in total
              spending.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging challenges. Since FY
              1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%, while Health
              Canada spending has decreased 19.9% when adjusted for inflation.

              The department's spending grew at a rate significantly lower than
              overall spending, reflecting shifts in federal priorities. In FY
              2024, Health Canada accounted for 2.7% of all federal spending,
              3.14 percentage points lower than in 1995.

              Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
              influence government spending year to year. For example, during
              the COVID-19 pandemic, federal support programs led to a temporary
              surge in spending. Health Canada expenditures increased from $5
              billion in FY 2019 to $14.2 billion in FY 2021 before stabilizing
              in recent years.
