              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging problems to address.
              Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%, while
              Transport spending has remained relatively flat.

              Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
              influence government spending year to year. For instance, during
              the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from
              $410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to
              $720.3 billion in 2021.

              Transport Canada is led by the Minister of Transport, who is
              appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime
              Minister and formally sworn into office at Rideau Hall. Upon
              appointment, the Minister takes the Oath of Office and the Oath of
              Allegiance, becoming a member of the King's Privy Council for
              Canada.

              The Minister of Transport is one of the cabinet members who serve
              at the Prime Minister's discretion. Their tenure typically ends
              when they resign, are replaced, or when a new Prime Minister
              appoints a new cabinet. Outgoing ministers continue in their roles
              until their successors are sworn in.
