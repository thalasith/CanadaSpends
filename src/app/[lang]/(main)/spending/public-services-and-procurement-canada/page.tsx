              The Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is the federal
              department responsible for providing centralized procurement, real
              estate management, pay and pension administration for federal
              employees, and translation services to the Government of Canada.
              It ensures that government departments have the goods, services,
              and infrastructure they need to operate efficiently while
              maintaining transparency, fairness, and value for taxpayers.

              Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth,
              changes in policy and programs, and emerging problems to address.
              Since 1995, overall federal spending has risen 74.9%, while PSPC
              spending has increased by 7.1% when adjusted for inflation.

              The department's spending has increased less than overall spending
              has grown and the department's share of the federal budget has
              decreased over time. In FY 2024, PSPC accounted for 1.6% of all
              federal spending, 1 percentage point lower than in 1995.

              Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
              acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
              influence government spending year to year. For instance, during
              the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from
              $410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to
              $720.3 billion in 2021.

              Similarly, PSPC's expenditures experienced notable fluctuations
              during this period, decreasing from approximately $6.8 billion​ in
              2019 (adjusted for inflation) to $5.3 billion in 2021 before
              increasing again in 2024.
